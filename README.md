# **Task Management System (To-Do List App)**
### A simple CLI-based To-Do List application in Python

## **Overview**  
This Task Management System is a command-line-based to-do list application that allows users to efficiently manage their tasks. It supports features like task creation, editing, deletion, marking tasks as completed, and persistent storage using a text file. The system also includes a basic user authentication mechanism for secure access.

✔️ **Edit Tasks** – Modify task descriptions and deadlines.  
✔️ **Delete Tasks** – Remove tasks from the list.  
✔️ **Mark as Completed** – Users can mark tasks as completed.  
✔️ **Persistent Storage** – Tasks are saved in a text file for future sessions.  
✔️ **User Authentication** – Basic login system to authenticate users.  
✔️ **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** – Simple and interactive CLI for ease of use.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Concepts Applied**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), File Handling, CRUD Operations  
- **Storage**: Text file (`tasks.txt`)
